# Quotes on Dev

A wordpress site that will show single quotes. It has an option for you to put in your own quotes as well as a button to randomly show you one.

## technologies used

This wordpress site uses wordpress as a starting point. Using CSS to style the pages and Ajax to get and post results. The Javascript is done with Jquery.

## difficulties encountered

I had 3 major challenges with this project.

1 Although, i am familiar with jquery, I am not well versed on it so trying to understand some things online as I search for ways to finish the project was a bit hard.

2. I had issues trying to fetch informartion using the filter parameter with REST API. I had to install a plug in call WP REST FILTER to try and fix the issue.

3. I got confused with the metabox and the REST API and I thought I had to combine them somehow. LOL
